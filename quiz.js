In the case of high-energy electrons, they can cause serious damage to satellite cables and computer chips through a process called deep dielectric charging that culminates in harmful discharges. When MeV electrons precipitate into Earth’s upper atmosphere, they can deplete ozone and affect chemical processes in the atmosphere.",
